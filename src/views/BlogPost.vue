                STORMZY UNVEILS MUSIC VIDEO FOR ‘RAINFALL’ FT. TIANA MAJOR9
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                British musician Stormzy has unveiled the incredible music video
                for ‘Rainfall’ (feat. Tiana Major9). Produced by Jay Weathers,
                ‘Rainfall’ is the latest single to be taken from his UK number
                #1, Gold-selling album, ‘Heavy Is The Head’. Watch HERE. The
                video has been created entirely inside Watch Dogs: Legion, a
                brand-new video game set in a near-future London which is set
                for release on October 29th. In a one-of-a-kind collaboration,
                the game features an exclusive mission titled ‘Fall on My
                Enemies’ which sees Stormzy enlisting the help of the resistance
                group, DedSec to protect the broadcast of the music video across
                the entire city. Stormzy is one of UK’s most inspiring and
                influential cultural figures. His two albums to date; ‘Gang
                Signs & Prayer’ and ‘Heavy Is The Head’ both reached #1 in the
                UK album chart and were subsequently nominated for the
                prestigious Mercury Music Prize. His remarkable ascent has been
                accompanied by his honest and relatable character – a true
                spokesman of black empowerment and social activism, he
                consistently stands up for people from all areas of life;
                encouraging his fans and listeners alike to speak openly about
                their beliefs and fight for their rights. “We are thrilled for
                Stormzy to be a part of Watch Dogs: Legion. His music and what
                he speaks to as an artist is extremely relevant for our London
                setting, and for the larger themes of our game,” commented Clint
                Hocking, Creative Director at Ubisoft Toronto. He added, “It’s
                been almost a year since we had Stormzy in the studio to film
                his performance. He lit up the room, and captivated us all. He’s
                a great collaborator, and it was a career highlight for us to
                get to work with him.“ Led by Ubisoft Toronto, Watch Dogs:
                Legion will release on Xbox One, PlayStation®4, Stadia and for
                Windows PC on Epic Games and Uplay on October 29th, 2020. The
                game will also be available on UPLAY+. Watch Dogs: Legion will
                also release on Xbox Series X|S on November 10th and
                PlayStation®5 upon the launch of those consoles. For more
